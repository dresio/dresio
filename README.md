## About me
I am a graduate student at Florida Atlantic University in the Ocean Engineering Department. My research involves developing on Autonomous Surface Vehicles and implementing systems using Robot Operating System and Gazebo.  
In my spare time I develop smaller robotic systems and other peripherals such as keyboards. This page is to focus and highlight the smaller hoby based projects I am developing. 


# Projects
## Scrappy:

</div>

Scrappy is a small open source robot that is designed out of commonly found equipment such as SLA batteries, stepper motors, and hobby grade servos. Using more common parts is aimed to lower the entry level of robotic developemnt with very modifiable systems. Any other non COTs part is aimed to be a m3 nut/bolt, a standard bearing size, or 3D printed plastic. 


## Keyboard: 
Currently under development is a 60% ortho-linear keyboard for my day to day use with low profile switches. The new aspect is that this will be collapsible ustilizing pogopins for the bridge to the second half of the board. 

## BBROS-Pi
This project is in the early research stages, however the goal is to develop a Bare Bones Robot Operating System on the Raspberry Pi. Not to be confused with Robot Operating System, this is to be a standalone operating system that brings ease to robotic deployment and debugging on a hardware level.
